## About the Course
CS 110 is an introduction to computer programming using Python, and assumes no prior programming knowledge. The intent of the course is twofold. First, we want to give you a sense of the kinds of problem-solving and creative pursuits that programming can support. Programming can be many different things — a representational medium, a tool for thinking about problems, a way of amplifying and/or communicating ideas, a means of performing complex calculations over massive datasets, and so forth. Most people who write computer programs are not computer scientists, but rather people who occupy a range of professions (journalists, geographers, sociologists, scientists, artists, musicians, entrepreneurs, researchers, etc.), and who use various programming languages to accomplish diverse and specialized goals. Moreover, as data and computing increasingly mediate modern life, knowing a bit about the mechanisms (and risks!) that underlie these systems is a valuable modern literacy that is likely to serve you well.

A second goal of the course is to introduce you to the fundamental constructs of computer programming, and some skills and strategies for helping you apply these low-level constructs in creative and useful ways. Towards this end, there will be quite a few drills and practice problems to get you familiar with ‘the basics.’ You need to dedicate enough time to practicing the basics: the fun, creative parts of programming are only possible when you understand the building blocks; and understanding comes from an active, consistent, and iterative engagement with new ideas. Taking this course means committing — for 10 weeks — to attending lectures and office hours, turning in assignments / projects, doing (lots of) practice problems, and most importantly, persevering when things get difficult and asking questions. We have an excellent staff of teaching assistants and peer mentors who are here just for you and your questions and ideas. With your consistent and active participation in your own learning, we can guide you through the material so that you can become a proficient programmer. Welcome to the course!

## Course Format

### Lectures
Lectures will a combination of synchronous and asynchronous content, which will include a combination of slides, pre-recorded "live-coding" videos (during lecture), programming exercises, and (sometimes) a mini-quiz. We will still be using the scheduled lecture time for more interactive Q&A sessions on Zoom with Sarah (professor Van Wart) to answer any questions about the material for that day. Organizationally, some topics/modules span multiple lectures (see the [course schedule](../)). So, you are encouraged to attend the regularly scheduled lecture sessions on Zoom, but everything will be recorded and posted to the website.

### Lab Sessions
This course involves weekly small-group lab sessions where you will work with a member of the teaching staff, beginning in Week 3. Lab sessions will be run synchronously (live) by your assigned peer mentors via Zoom. During each lab session, you will work through an exercise together with your peer mentor, to advance your understanding of targeted programming concepts. Lab sessions count for 10% of your grade.

{:.blockquote-no-margin}
> You must complete/attend **at least five lab sessions** (4 points each).

There are two ways to earn full participation credit in each lab session:

1. By attending them (synchronously), working through the exercises, and asking questions (as they arise).
2. By turning in the lab exercise(s) ***before*** the lab session. Lab exercises will be posted at the beginning of the week (at least 48 hours in advance).

I (prof. Van Wart) have a strong preference for option #1, because it's a form of low-pressure, built-in accountability that will help you learn. That said, it's up to you. Attending and working in the labs is worth 10% of your grade.  But you have to actually work -- if you zone out, we will know, and will not give you credit.

Following the submission deadline, a solution and walkthrough of each problem will be made available via Canvas.

## Getting Questions Answered


### Assignment & Programming Questions
For assignment and programming related questions you should post questions on our class Piazza site. Before you post a question, please do a quick search to make sure that one of your classmates hasn’t already asked the same question. Piazza gives you the option of posting anonymously (to your classmates) so that you don’t feel intimidated to ask a question. As a general rule, do not post ANY code that would be part of an answer to an assignment question. It is critical that you use Piazza for assignment questions; any assignment questions emailed directly to any course staff will be forwarded to Piazza.

If you have a question about code that requires you to show someone your code, please go to one of the peer mentor office hours. These hours (days/times/locations) are posted on a google calendar linked to from the Piazza resources page (under the ‘course information’ tab) for our class. In general, please use the peer mentor hours, these mentors were selected from a large number of applicants and are highly qualified!


### Grading Questions
For grading questions/concerns you should go to the graduate TA’s grading office hours (also posted on the google calendar). You can also send them a private message through Piazza with assignment grading questions/concerns.


### Other Questions
For any other issues that you think are not appropriate for the peer mentors or graduate TAs, please come talk to me. This might include things like concerns about your progress in the course, questions about content from my lectures, personal matter related to your participation in the course, larger grade concerns, advice about future courses, majors and internships, etc.

## Office Hours

Office hours and locations / Zoom links are posted <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/times-locations/">here</a>. See the course Canvas page for the Zoom password.

## Grading
Your course grade is calculated based on 200 points as follows:

{:.small}
| **2 Projects** | 2 x 40 Points | 80 Points | 40% |
| **1 Exam** | 60 Points | 60 Points | 30% |
| **5 Homeworks** | 5 x 8 Points | 40 Points | 20% |
| **5 Labs** | 5 x 4 Points | 20 Points | 10% |
| | | **200 Points** | **100%** |

Ordinarily, final grades are assigned on a fixed scale: 93-100 is 
an A, 90-92.99 is an A-, 87-89.99 is a B+, etc. However in light of the 
COVID-19 situation, the provost has instituted **Pass/No Pass** grading 
for all undergraduate students. In this class, that means that if you earn
at least 140 points (i.e. a 70% or above), you pass.

To me, the P/NP option is a wonderful opportunity to explore ideas without
the stress. That said, I absolutely encourage you to complete ALL of the 
assignments to the best of your ability. Some other logistics:

1. Final course grades will not be rounded or curved.
1. We will not be using the final exam time for this class.
1. Exam 2 will be on the last day of class (Thursday, 6/4). The purpose of Exam 2 is to get a second chance if for some reason, 
don't do well on your first exam.


### Homework Grading

Homework will be approximately weekly. They are due at 11:59pm on Tuesdays unless otherwise specified.

We will still accept late homework up to 48 hours after the original due date, but with a 2 point penalty (25%). Homework is graded on the following scale:

|--|--|
| **No submission** | 0 Points | Little to no understanding/effort demonstrated |
| **Check minus** | 4 Points | Some effort made, but significant features are missing or not working |
| **Check** | 6 Points | Mostly working, but some errors or issues were found |
| **Check Plus**| 8 Points | Working exactly as it should |

On occasion, this testing/grading may make an error. You will receive your assignment grades on Canvas. If you have any grading questions/concerns, please send a private message on Piazza within 1 week to the graduate TA (Mohammed Alam - MohammedAlam2009@u.northwestern.edu) to resolve the issue. We will NOT drop any scores in this class, but ***may*** offer up to 15 points of extra credit. Finally, it is your responsibility to keep up-to-date on class material and announcements. This includes material presented and announcements made in class, via email, or on Piazza.

## Policy on Academic Honesty

In the past, there have been a few unfortunate instances in which students have presented work other than their own. For the programming assignments: You are allowed (encouraged, even!) to discuss general approaches to solving problems, but all work you submit must be your own. Working “together” and presenting variants of the same file is not acceptable. Here are some specific guidelines to make sure you don’t cross the line:

* Do not exchange programs or program fragments in any form – on paper, via e-mail, or by other means.
* Do not copy solutions from any source, including the web or previous EECS 110 students.
* While working with other students, it is perfectly acceptable to ‘look’ at each other’s code (perhaps while helping someone to debug), but you should NEVER be scribing (typing or writing) your own work while looking at someone else’s (on a computer screen, paper, whiteboard, etc.).
* Uploading materials from this course to websites that sell such content to students is prohibited by Northwestern’s academic integrity policies, and may also put you at risk for violating copyright policies in Northwestern’s Student Conduct Code.

Contact Sarah Van Wart if you have any questions about what is appropriate.
