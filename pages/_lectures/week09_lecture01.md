Today, we are going to finish our Spotify example from [Lecture 21](week08-lecture03), and think about how we might use a dictionary of tracks to download some album covers and audio samples (akin to how a web crawler / scraper might work).

I've attached my code from Friday's in-class coding activities for those who were not able to make the Friday lecture. This zip file contains the edits I made to `utilities.py` as well as an updated `03_spotify_data.py` file, which we will build on.
